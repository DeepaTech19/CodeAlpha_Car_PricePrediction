### Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸš—ðŸ“Š
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars based on several features like 
car age, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and more. The aim is to build a regression model 
that helps estimate car prices and understand key influencing factors.

## Dataset:-
 - Source: Kaggle â€“ Used Car Price Prediction
 - Features:
    Car Name
    Year
    Selling Price
    Present Price
    Kms Driven
    Fuel Type
    Seller Type
    Transmission
    Owner
- Goal: Predict the selling price of a car using a regression model.

## Tools Used:-
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy â€“ data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ data visualization
- Scikit-learn â€“ model training & evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code â€“ development environment

## Output:-
 - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
 - Performed:
      Exploratory Data Analysis
      Label Encoding of categorical variables
      Correlation & heatmap visualization
      Trained a regression model (Linear Regression)
      Evaluated model performance using RÂ² score

## Internship Task Submission:-
This project was submitted as part of my internship at Code Alpha under the Data Science domain.
It showcases the end-to-end process of solving a real-world machine learning problem â€” from data preprocessing to model deployment.
